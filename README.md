# AI-Powered Backend Service

This repository provide the backend functionality for AI and LLM models that integrates **Pinecone** for vector database search and **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo** for generating conversational responses. The service is built with **NestJS** and designed to handle real-time user queries securely and efficiently.

## Project Overview

## Key Features

- **AI-driven responses**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to generate relevant responses based on user queries.
- **Pinecone Vector Database**: Retrieves relevant documents from Pinecone to provide context for AI responses.
- **API Key-based Authentication**: Protects the API from unauthorized access using an API key.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements rate-limiting to prevent abuse and ensure service availability.

## Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to provide the backend functionality for AI and LLM models such as chatbot which can be embedded on a personal or business website. Users can ask questions, and the chatbot will retrieve relevant information from a Pinecone vector database before providing a meaningful response generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.

The project includes API key authentication and rate-limiting mechanisms to secure the service from malicious use and abuse while maintaining a smooth user experience.
